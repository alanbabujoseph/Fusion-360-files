# Transparent Glass Bottle â€“ Fusion 360 Design

## ðŸ“„ Overview
This project features a **transparent glass bottle** designed in Autodesk Fusion 360.  
The design was created as part of my CAD portfolio to showcase **precision modeling, realistic rendering, and product-ready design**.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Accurate Dimensions** â€“ Modeled to standard bottle proportions.
- **Realistic Glass Appearance** â€“ Material and render settings for photorealism.
- **Parametric Design** â€“ Easily adjustable height, neck diameter, and wall thickness.
- **Manufacturing Ready** â€“ Suitable for mold manufacturing or 3D printing (with adjustments).
