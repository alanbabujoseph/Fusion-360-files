# Helical Screw â€“ Fusion 360 Design

## ðŸ“„ Overview
This project features a **parametric helical screw (singleâ€‘start blade)** modeled in Autodesk Fusion 360.  
It highlights **clean, featureâ€‘driven modeling**, **precise control of pitch/turns**, and **productionâ€‘ready exports**.

---

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Accurate Geometry** â€“ Outer/inner diameters, pitch, turns, and thickness are fully parametric.
- **Realistic Metal Render** â€“ Materials and environment tuned for a polished look.
- **Editable Timeline** â€“ Clearly named sketches and features for quick tweaks.
- **Manufacturingâ€‘Ready** â€“ Exported STEP for CAM; STL optional for printing.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools Used (Fusion 360)
- **Coil / Helix** â€“ Generates the helical path using diameter, pitch, and turns.
- **Sweep** â€“ Forms the blade by sweeping a profile along the helix.
- **Loft** (optional) â€“ For tapered or blended blade profiles between stations.
- **Thicken** â€“ Converts surface sweeps to solids at a specified thickness.
- **Fillet** â€“ Softens edges to reduce stress risers and improve printability.
- **Combine** â€“ Joins the blade to the shaft or cuts a bore/keyway.
- **Mirror** â€“ Quickly switch handedness or duplicate symmetric features.

## ðŸ”§ Key Parameters (Modify â†’ Change Parameters)
- `outer_diameter` â€“ Blade OD  
- `inner_diameter` â€“ Shaft/bore diameter  
- `pitch` â€“ Axial advance per revolution  
- `turns` â€“ Number of helical revolutions  
- `thickness` â€“ Blade thickness (after **Thicken**)  
- `fillet_radius` â€“ Edge rounding

> Handedness can be flipped by mirroring or reversing helix direction.

## ðŸš€ Manufacturing Notes
- **CNC/CAM:** Use the STEP export. For finishing, apply scallop/parallel passes on the blade surface; verify tool reach and holder clearance.  
- **3D Printing:** Orient the axis vertically to minimize supports under the blade. Use 3â€“5 perimeters and â‰¥25% infill; increase `thickness` for FDM durability.
